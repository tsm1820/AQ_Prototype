This is part of a research study, “Improving Professional Development through an Intelligent Adaptive Learning Approach”, conducted by Associate Professor Goh Yang Miang (bdggym@nus.edu.sg) of the Department of Built Environment, College of Design and Engineering, NUS.

This quiz is designed to assess your knowledge on Project Monitoring and Control, specifically on earned value management, scope, schedule and cost management. The data collected from this quiz will be used to validate the quizzes.
 
This non-graded quiz contains 10 questions and will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. There is no penalty for wrong answers, but do your best. This is an anonymous study; however, personal identifiers (index numbers) will only be collected to link the different data collected throughout the study. These unique identifiers will be discarded immediately once the coding is done so no data can be connected to the participants. 

Please take note that this activity will not contribute to your academic grades. Your participation in this research study is voluntary.
 
Feel free to put your queries if you have any feedbacks or suggestions.
